The  core of this project relies on version control system, which would be interacted safely with using a wrapper written in C++ so that we can easily call the functions  in a failsafe manner, which does not  affect the stability of the system.



## Stability of System
The main aim of this experiment is to ensure stability in systems, and if this project is not stable in itself, there is no way we can ensure stability or healing nature of the operating system we are running this utility upon.
